In order to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We have put in place the following security procedures and technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data:\n\n·Your personal data is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.\n\n·All data saved in the back-end is classified into different levels based on the importance and sensitivity of the data, e.g. whether the data contains personal data.\n\n·In the data centres, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology, and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.\n\n·Data exchanged between eWeLink devices and servers are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”).\n\n·There is an optional two-step verification process when users access their eWeLink Account.\n\n·There is regular review of information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorised access to systems.\n\n·Access is restricted to eWeLink employees and Third Party Service Providers who need to know that information in order to process it, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations.\n\n·There are also access controls for all server clusters used for cloud-based data storage and process.\n\n·Most data used for eWeLink’s products and/or services is stored in a storage system. By using column family based access control mechanism, eWeLink employees are only allowed access to the data column families they are granted access to.\n\n·Please note also that for the above, eWeLink may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by eWeLink to process or back up your personal data. Currently, eWeLink has data centres in Beijing and Singapore. As a result, we may transfer to and store your personal data at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nInformation safety is very important to us. We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal data. Through our protective measures above, especially encrypted storage and transmission, your data is as secure as it can be. Certain details of encrypted data cannot be accessed by anyone except by you.",
